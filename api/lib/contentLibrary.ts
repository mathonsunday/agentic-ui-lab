/**
 * Content Library: Hardcoded Production Features
 *
 * This service explicitly catalogs all hardcoded content features in the system.
 * Rather than hiding feature logic in conditionals, this makes it clear that these
 * are intentional production features with curated content—not tests or experiments.
 *
 * Design philosophy:
 * - Content features are first-class citizens, not hidden implementation details
 * - Each feature has clear metadata about its purpose and implementation
 * - Discovery is straightforward: look at this file to see all hardcoded features
 * - Extensibility: adding new content features follows a clear pattern
 *
 * This helps both human developers and AI agents understand the codebase:
 * - No mysterious conditionals in analyze-user-stream.ts
 * - Clear intent: these are intentional product features, not hacks
 * - Centralized content management: changes to text happen in one place
